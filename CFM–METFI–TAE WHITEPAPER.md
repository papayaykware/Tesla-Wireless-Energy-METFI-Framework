## Abstract

The dominant symbolic–computational paradigm has proven structurally insufficient for describing biological, cognitive and geophysical systems operating far from equilibrium. Increasing theoretical and experimental evidence indicates that such systems behave as **constraint‑driven field processes**, where dynamics, stability and adaptation emerge from coherence limits and topological restrictions rather than symbolic rule execution.

This whitepaper analyses the **Constrained Field Model (CFM)** as a deterministic, φ‑scaled, non‑semantic mathematical substrate for studying the evolution, stabilisation and bifurcation of multi‑channel constrained fields. The model is examined in structural alignment with **METFI** (Earth as an Electromagnetic Toroidal Internal Forcing system) and **TAE** (Theory of Learning by Exception), proposing a unified formalism capable of describing learning, adaptation and collapse phenomena across biological and planetary scales without invoking agency, intelligence or semantic representation.

## 1. Introduction

> [!NOTE]
> This document intentionally avoids regulatory or institutional sources with structural conflicts of interest.

Classical computational metaphors describe complex systems as programs acting on symbolic data. While effective in closed formal domains, this approach collapses when applied to living or planetary systems characterised by continuous coupling, distributed causality and non‑linear phase transitions.

The **CFM** proposes a shift in abstraction: from symbolic computation to **field‑level constraint dynamics**. In this view, systems evolve within restricted state spaces shaped by topology, coherence thresholds and energetic coupling. Function is not executed but *emerges*.

---

## 2. The Constrained Field Model

### Definition

CFM is a **deterministic, φ‑scaled field‑dynamics substrate** designed to analyse how constrained multi‑channel fields evolve, stabilise and bifurcate under coherence limits.

### What CFM is *not*

* ❌ Not an AI
* ❌ Not an agent
* ❌ Not a consciousness claim
* ❌ Not semantic

> [!IMPORTANT]
> CFM operates strictly as a **non‑semantic computational layer**.

The φ‑scaling introduces structured self‑similarity consistent with empirical observations in morphogenesis, toroidal electromagnetism and biological coherence phenomena.

---

## 3. CFM and TAE

**TAE** frames learning as a discontinuous process triggered by *exception* — the collapse of coherence that forces a system into a new configuration. This aligns directly with **field bifurcations** in CFM.

Learning is therefore:

* Non‑accumulative
* Non‑symbolic
* Driven by constraint reconfiguration

CFM provides the mathematical substrate capable of formalising this process without invoking representational memory.

---

## 4. Biological Coherence as Field Dynamics

Work by **Fröhlich**, **Ho** and **Vitiello** demonstrates that biological systems maintain long‑range coherence far beyond thermal noise expectations.

Within CFM, cells and tissues are modelled as **restricted electromagnetic fields**, where membranes, cytoskeletal structures and charge distributions define boundary conditions.

> [!TIP]
> Coherence loss corresponds to field destabilisation, not molecular failure.

---

## 5. Genetics as Bioinformatic Field Architecture

DNA functions not as executable code but as a **resonant constraint structure** shaping the bioinformatic field.

Gene expression emerges from:

* Field stabilisation
* Topological compatibility
* Energetic coherence

This interpretation aligns with **causal downward biology** (Noble) and auto‑organisation theory (Kauffman).

---

## 6. Exosomes and Field Perturbations

Exosomes act as **boundary perturbations** capable of reconfiguring recipient field constraints.

Their systemic impact exceeds molecular payload size, consistent with a **field‑state transfer** interpretation.

---

## 7. METFI: Planetary‑Scale Constrained Fields

METFI models Earth as a **toroidal electromagnetic system with dominant internal forcing**. Loss of toroidal symmetry induces non‑linear geophysical and biological effects.

CFM supplies the formal field language required to describe such symmetry loss without linear forcing assumptions.

---

## 8. Structural Critique of Symbolic Computation

Symbolic models assume discrete manipulable units. Field systems do not.

CFM removes representational bias, enabling:

* Distributed causality
* Continuous state evolution
* Constraint‑driven adaptation

---

## 9. Programs of Seguimiento

### 9.1 Cellular Coherence Seguimiento

* Bioelectric phase coherence under geometric confinement
* Detection of bifurcation thresholds

### 9.2 Exosomal Perturbation Seguimiento

* Non‑linear systemic responses post‑transfer
* Synchronisation metrics

### 9.3 Neuro‑Cardiac Coupling Seguimiento

* Phase‑locking analysis
* Exception‑driven reorganisation events

### 9.4 Geophysical–Biological Correlation Seguimiento

* Local geomagnetic variation vs biological coherence

> [!WARNING]
> Seguimiento focuses on **field dynamics**, not molecular proxies alone.

---

## 10. Integrated Interpretation

CFM acts as a **shared dynamical substrate**:

* METFI → planetary field scale
* TAE → adaptive learning dynamics
* Biology → coherent constrained fields

Together they form a non‑symbolic, non‑teleological description of complex systems.

---

## Final Summary

* CFM formalises constraint‑driven field dynamics
* METFI and CFM are structurally compatible
* TAE maps naturally to field bifurcation
* Genetics operates as field architecture
* Exosomes transmit field states
* Seguimiento can test coherence and symmetry loss
